# **Project Summary**:

This project has as analysis content the sector of the taxi industry, since it is a field that allows us to know much more about the behavior and needs of the city and its inhabitants, apart from this this type of service currently competes with other solutions that once again highlight the need to be at the forefront of ICT issues.

## **Develoment of the project**
To meet the objective of this project, it was carried out in three phases or stages, which are the following:
1. Cleaning and analysis of data.
2. Preparation and selection of the model.
3. Results and recommendations.

## CONCLUSIONS
- By comparing the various regression models used in this project, it was observed that the LightGbm allows us to estimate a better predictive model in relation to its analogs.
- The most relevant characteristics for the creation of the best model have been the variables related to the distance between the starting point and the destination, location of the trips, type of trip, average duration, number of passengers thereof, etc.
-  The implementation of technologies such as Machine Learning allow companies to be prepared for the new challenges of the new digital era in which we find ourselves. From the implementation of models that facilitate the understanding and understanding of the needs of its consumers and thus offer a better service.
